            <p>
                Hey everyone! Today, I want to dive into a significant chapter of my life—my 
                experience as the Vice President of the Interact Club at Goldengate International College. 
                This role was incredibly formative for me, and I’m excited to share my journey with you.

                           <p>Taking on the role of Vice President was both challenging and rewarding. I was responsible for 
                            leading various community service projects, which involved planning charitable events and coordinating with local organizations. 
                            Each project aimed to make a positive impact on our community, and I had the opportunity to see how our collective efforts could 
                            truly make a difference. 
                            Balancing multiple projects helped me develop strong time management and leadership skills.

                                    of teamwork as we collaborated on various initiatives. Organizing events required extensive 
                                    coordination and communication, and it was crucial to ensure that everyone was aligned with our 
                                    goals. This role taught me how powerful a united team can be and how essential it is to work together towards a common purpose.

                                    and manage expectations from both our school and the community. 
                                    This role was about finding the right balance between the needs of the club and 
                                    the demands of our external stakeholders. It was a challenging task, but it taught me 
                                    how to handle pressure and make decisions that were in the best interest of the club while 
                                    staying true to our mission.
